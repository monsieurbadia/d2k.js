# d2k.js | rendering engine

as a *rapper*, this project is a kind of *freestyle* about programming a rendering engine using webgl api. I do not know all the basics but i wanna learn how to create a webgl micro-library from scratch..
this is just the beginning, i trying to figure out to webgl api behavior and how i can communicate with it. I do not know nothing about math so i use gl-matrix to help me with the math cases.

if somebody want to help, feel free to contribute. let's do it.
