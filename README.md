> *javascript micro-layer to 3d engine libraries to create primitives in an elegant and modular way.*

# Problem

- dry (don't repeat yourself) by implementing the same scenes, cameras, lights, meshes, renderers.
- against the babylon vs three

# Solution

## Goal

d2k must :
  - supports json config
  - supports glsl
  - supports babylon.js
  - supports three.js
  - define an abstract that can be easiest to used
  - define the file in which the class is declared
  - define the weight of code lines
